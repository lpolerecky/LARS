## Input data in a spreadsheet

Input data needs to be organized in a spreadsheet. A template spreadsheet is available in the folder *templates*.

**Look@Rates** reads input data from an Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). The required data are organized in columns, with rows corresponding to individual cells. The required data are described in [Table 1](man/figures/LARS_input_data_format.docx)

Look@Rates exports calculated rates as a new sheet (called “rates”) in the input Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). The output values are organized in columns, with rows corresponding to individual cells. Table below describes the output data.
