**Look@Rates** - a Matlab script for calculating *substrate assimilation rates* in cells from their isotopic composition determined by nanoSIMS.

## Input data

**Look@Rates** reads input data from an Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). The required data are organized in columns, with rows corresponding to individual cells. The required data are described in [Table 1](../../man/figures/LARS_input_data_format.docx). A template spreadsheet is available in the folder [templates](../../man/templates/).

## Output data 

**Look@Rates** exports calculated rates as a new sheet (called *rates*) in the input Excel spreadsheet (xlsx). The output values are organized in columns, with rows corresponding to individual cells. The output data are described in [Table 2](../../man/figures/LARS_output_data_format.docx).
